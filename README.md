## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, you.

We’re challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**—a new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It’s **locally trained and hosted**—your data, your control—yet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it’s your AI identity interface—a bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow’s truly native AI apps.

Join us. Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts—Second Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

</p>


### **Scale Your Intelligence** on the Second Me Network
Launch your AI self from your laptop onto our decentralized network—anyone or any app can connect with your permission, sharing your context as your digital identity.

## Quick Start

### Installation and Setup

#### Prerequisites
- macOS operating system
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher (for frontend)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

#### Installing Xcode Command Line Tools
If you haven't installed Xcode Command Line Tools yet, you can install them by running:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

After installation, you may need to accept the license agreement:
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Set up the environment

#### Option A: For users with existing conda environment
If you already have conda installed:

1) Create a new environment from our environment file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml   # This will create an environment named 'second-me'
conda activate second-me
```

2) Set the custom conda mode in `.env`:
```bash
CUSTOM_CONDA_MODE=true
```

3) Run setup:
```bash
make setup
```

#### Option B: For new users
If you're new or want a fresh environment:
```bash
make setup
```

This command will automatically:
- Install all required system dependencies (including conda if not present)
- Create a new Python environment named 'second-me'
- Build llama.cpp
- Set up frontend environment

3. Start the service
```bash
make start
```

4. Access the service
Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

5. View help and more commands
```bash
make help
```

### Important Notes
1. Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least 10GB recommended)
2. If using an existing conda environment, ensure there are no conflicting package versions
3. First startup may take a few minutes to download and install dependencies
4. Some commands may require sudo privileges

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, check:
1. Python and Node.js versions meet requirements
2. You're in the correct conda environment
3. All dependencies are properly installed
4. System firewall allows the application to use required ports
